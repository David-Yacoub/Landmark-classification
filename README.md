# Landmark Classification & tagging

Photo sharing and photo storage services like to have location data for each photo that is uploaded. With the location data, these services can build advanced features, such as automatic suggestion of relevant tags or automatic photo organization, which help provide a compelling user experience. Although a photo's location can often be obtained by looking at the photo's metadata, many photos uploaded to these services will not have location metadata available. This can happen when, for example, the camera capturing the picture does not have GPS or if a photo's metadata is scrubbed due to privacy concerns.
In this project, I take the first steps towards addressing this problem by building models to automatically predict the location of the image based on any landmarks depicted in the image. I went through the machine learning design process end-to-end: performing data preprocessing, designing and training CNNs, comparing the accuracy of different CNNs, and using my own images to heuristically evaluate your best CNN.
